- Be able to perform a simple sample size calculation
- Understand the basics of experimental design

## Intro slide

## Syllabus/timetable for the day

## General goal: be able to create a statistical model of a biomarker panel and check that it is robust

## Basics of data: continuous vs discrete, ordinal vs interval vs nominal
