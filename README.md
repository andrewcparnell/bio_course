# Course: Time Series for Ecologists and Climatologists

## About

We  cover model-based time series analysis with a particular focus on applications in ecology and climatology. All methods are illustrated using the free, open-source software package R. Time Series data are ubiquitous in the physical sciences, and models for their behaviour enable scientists to understand temporal dynamics and predict future values.

Participants are taught a wide range of suitable time series models for both discrete and continuous time systems. The course takes a foundational Bayesian approach, which will enable participants to have a deeper understanding of the models being fitted, and to estimate all unknown quantities with uncertainty. Participants are encouraged to bring their own data sets for discussion with the course tutors.

## Intended audience

Research postgraduates, practicing academics in climatology, meteorology, conservation and environmental management, and environmental professionals in government and industry.
